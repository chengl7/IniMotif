# IniMotif

## Installation

The recommended way to setup your computer for running Inimotif is to install the official distribution of Python 3.7. You can download the official Python 3.7 distribution [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375). Once you've installed Python, open the terminal/prompt and enter the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/chengl7/IniMotif.git
```
This will install IniMotif. Note that Inimotif may work for versions of Python 3 prior to 3.7, but this is untested. For Mac you may need to update Tcl/Tk to use the GUI for versions of Python prior to 3.7.2. See [here](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/) for more information.

To run Inimotif you can use the following command from any directory:
```
inimotif_gui.py
```
